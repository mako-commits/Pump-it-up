# Pump-it-up

## Context
Pump-it-up project
Can you predict which water pumps are faulty?

## Goal
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed.

A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues.
